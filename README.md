# Competitive-Programming-Club

## About
The CP Club is a technical organization of students in the campus of [Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya](http://www.ggu.ac.in/), that works under the parent community namely
[Developer Student Clubs](https://dsc.community.dev/guru-ghasidas-vishwavidyalaya/)

## Vision
The Competitive Programming Club is a group of students who enjoy solving hard problems quickly with code. 
The aim will be to meet on a regular basis to practice and learn together. The problems we will work on will also be highly applicable to technical job interviews. 
The clubâ€™s objective is not teaching members how to code, but it is to help members to code efficiently and to teach them algorithms that can be used to achieve that goal.
